2.2.0	10-03-2021	Steffen Skov

	* Added Bind<TInterface, TImplementation> and Unbind<TInterface> methods on the ServiceLocator class for easily mocking / faking dependencies for unit tests.
	* Converted the basic ServiceLocator to be static, as the Bind and Unbind methods work in a static fashion, and this is easier to comprehend when everything is static.
	* Moved the ServiceLocator classes to reside straight in the Ckode namespace as the class name collides with the namespace otherwise.
